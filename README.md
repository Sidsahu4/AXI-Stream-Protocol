# AXI-Stream-Protocol
The AXI4-Stream protocol is part of the AMBA AXI (Advanced eXtensible Interface) family from ARM, used for data streaming applications. It’s a lightweight, unidirectional, and address-free protocol, designed for high-speed data transfer between master and slave components. Here are some key features of the AXI4-Stream protocol:

Data Transfer: It transfers data in a continuous stream, which is useful for video, audio, and other bulk data applications. Unlike AXI4 or AXI4-Lite, AXI4-Stream doesn’t need to address individual memory locations, making it ideal for high-throughput scenarios.

Channels: There are two primary channels involved in AXI4-Stream:

TREADY: Indicates if the slave is ready to receive data.
TVALID: Indicates if the master has valid data to send. Data transfer occurs only when both TREADY and TVALID are asserted.
Control Signals:

TREADY (Ready): This is an output from the slave indicating it can accept data.
TVALID (Valid): This is an output from the master indicating it has valid data to send.
TDATA (Data): Carries the actual payload.
TSTRB (Strobe): Indicates which bytes within the data bus are valid (used for partial transfers).
TLAST: Used to signal the end of a data transfer (useful in packetized transfers).
TID, TDEST, TKEEP, TUSER: Optional signals used for tagging, routing, and custom control.
Handshake: Data transfer occurs only if TVALID is asserted by the master and TREADY is asserted by the slave. This handshaking mechanism ensures synchronized data transfer.

Clock and Reset: All transactions are synchronized to a common clock signal, and the reset signal is used to initialize the states of the master and slave.

AXI4-Stream is often used for connecting processing elements in high-speed data paths, such as between a DMA (Direct Memory Access) and an FPGA, or in video/audio processing blocks where continuous, non-addressed data streams are needed.
